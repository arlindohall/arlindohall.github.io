Build a website with `pandoc` and GitHub pages
===

GitHub pages is an awesome tool for building a website.
If you don't set up any themes or configure jekyll to transform markdown, you can still have a pretty easy setup and automation.
I've set up this website using Amazon Route53, GitHub pages, and `pandoc` with GitHub actions.

Pages hosts the site at <https://arlindohall.github.io>, but I wanted to use a custom domain, so I used GitHub pages' [built-in support for custom domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages).

When I first set up the website, I built the HTML by hand, but I quickly realized that I was re-using huge chunks of HTML for each page.
At that point I tried to use CommonMark JS to compile the markdown pages into HTML, which gave me anchor links and other cool features, but I didn't like the build process, so I kept looking.

I've used `pandoc` in the past to build PDF documents and slides, so I gave it a try and found that by using a template I could get almost all of the functionality I wanted. On top of that, by using a few plugins and a tiny bit of javascript, I was able to get a fully static, performant, and accessible website using the following steps.

Pandoc actions
---

The script [compile.sh](https://github.com/arlindohall/arlindohall.github.io/blob/main/compile.sh) reads the files in `_posts` and `_root`, (which get ignored by pages) and compiles them with pandoc into HTML, with the output directories of `posts` and `/` respectively.

The script gets run by GitHub actions after installing `pandoc` (you have to run apt as root to install in actions).
Then I use GitHub actions' push functionality to commit the changes back to the repo.
This way I only have to write markdown and then the HTML gets auto-generated by actions.

Anchor Links
---

I think anchor links are a really important feature for a mostly-text website like this one.
I used pandoc because it gave me accessibility by producing vanilla HTML instead of using javascript or especially a JS framework.
That said, I looked and looked for a native pandoc feature that would generate anchor links for each header and just couldn't find one.
I noticed that `pandoc`'s own manual is generated with `pandoc`, and it has anchor links, but best I can tell they use a custom Haskell plugin to do that.
I also found the following links to google groups discussions of people trying to do the same thing.

Since anchor links already aren't going to be as useful to a browser like lynx or a screen reader, I figured it would be an okay shortcut to use javascript for these, which I did by just adding it to the template.

This website is a work in progress.
