<h1 id="this-website">This Website</h1>
<p>I've been writing code professionally since 2017, and I’m learning more every day. I’ve written a little bit of frontend code at work. But the thing is that at work, I have lots of tooling that makes it really easy, and I haven’t actually learned much about web fundamentals.</p>
<p>The reason I’ve built this website is to force myself to actually learn about how frontend web technologies work, and as I learn more, hopefully this site gets better.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, this site is pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>I fetch all the content as markdown</li>
<li>I use commonmark.js to render the markdown client-side</li>
</ul>
<p>Some questions I thought of while I was making this website are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why did you use GitHub pages for your personal site?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>jt’s really easy and completely free to set up a website with GitHub pages. I don’t want to invest much time or energy into this when I’m not really committed to making something interesting out of it. It’s just a place to host stuff online for now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why did you write your own client side code instead of just using Jekyll?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is opposed to my answer to the last question (since it would be really easy to lean into Jekyll and just host a bunch of markdown files with no HTML/CSS), but I wanted a little bit more control over the site and how it looked, and the ability to add some dynamic functionality in the future if I decide to. Also, I didn’t want to learn a whole new tool (Jekyll themes) in order to be able to have a website that was really customized.</p>
<p>Since I’ve written this site to be all static HTML and JS/CSS, it will be really easy to move off Jekyll if I ever need to. The easy way to do something is always better than not doing it at all.</p>
