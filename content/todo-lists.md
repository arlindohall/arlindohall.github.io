# Todo Lists

*(Work in Progress)*

Everyone has their own little productivity hacks that work for them.
One of the most popular is called "Getting Things Done," and while I've never actually used it in full, I've tried variations of it over the years.
I know it is based on tracking work on little index cards, and it's a lot like the system I've settled into.
Maybe there's a hint in there about GTD being some kind of local maximum in productivity-space.

## Deciding what to work on

At work (unless you're self-employed), you don't have much choice in what you're going to work on (and even _if_ you're self-employed, you still have to, you know, make money so you can buy food).
So it's easy enough to decide what you've got to work on for the next week or month or so.

At home, my method for deciding what to work on is mostly shame-based, and it's taken me a long time to come to terms with that as "just the way my brain works."
I will say, if you're like me, this system works just fine and you shouldn't feel guilty about it.
If you don't mind your clothes stacked up on your dresser instead of being put away, then leave them there.
And if you've tackled the other things in your house that bother you, then put them away.
Or don't.
My college roommate put his clothes onto a bookshelf so he didn't have to open drawers.
Nobody actually enforces the rules you think you have to follow.
So just work on the things that bother you.

## Making a list

So now that you know what to work on, just make a todo list.
It should be as simple as possible.
I've used a clipboard with loose-leaf paper, a planner, and a spiral notebook.I think the planner is my favorite because I always *have* to turn the page, or at least I feel like I have to.
Which is important when you get to...

## Throwing the list away

You should recycle your todo lists.
Don't let them sit for too long, or they'll get stale and eventually you'll never be able to prioritize anything.
You should throw your lists away if they're unbound, and if they're in a notebook or a planner, you should turn the page.
I recommend throwing the list out every day.
Don't copy items over.
If you do have things you didn't get done, then re-word them.
The re-wording is a critical step, because probably you learned something while you were working on them, and by re-wording, you're refining the definition of the work you have to do so that it's easier to do today.
