# How to run a meeting

*(Work in Progress)*

I've been on two teams at Amazon since I started there in 2017,
and on both teams I evetually ended up leading the sprint meetings.
I think the reason for this is a mix between just being willing to
do so and having some ability to run a meeting, so this essay is
my attempt to describe how I think about meetings in case you find
it helpful.

Problems in running a meeting

- Staying on topic
- Keeping track of tangents
- Ending on time

When I was at Clemson, I was a student tutor (we called the
role "supplemental instructor"), and we had a technique called
"Running List of Questions" where we would keep track of every
question someone had on the board. Whenever someone felt their
question had been answered, whether it was a direct answer or
if they had just picked up the necessary context, we would
mark it off the list. Keeping a physical list ensures nobody
gets left behind and questions are all wrapped up, while marking
things off the list ensures we don't hammer things to death if
they've already been addressed.
