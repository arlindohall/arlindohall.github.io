# Inbox Zero is dumb

*(Work in Progress)*

I'm pretty easily distracted, but I don't think that having a clean inbox does anything to make me focus better.
I really love clean surfaces (and I do keep my Desktop clean on my computer), but I just don't see the appeal of an empty inbox.

I spent daily effort for like ten years to keep inbox zero, but when I migrated to [HEY](hey.com), their user interface was so intuitive and immediately useful without having inbox zero, that I started keeping things in my inbox and never looked back.
Now, my work inbox looks just like HEY, even though I use Outlook at work.
All incoming emails go straight to my Inbox.
Once there, I decide if I want to set up a rule to put them in the feed or paper trail, which most of the time means I don't even look at them.
And things from my inbox are really easy to just skim through and mark as read.

One key difference at work (that I actually kind of like) is that my work emails all show up as unread, even if in the feed or paper trail.
That said, I don't miss the stress of leaving newsletters unread.
I think if a newsletter is important in HEY, I can put it in my inbox.
