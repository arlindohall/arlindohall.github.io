# Miller Hall

- I am a software developer and tinkerer based in Herndon, Virginia
- Software is my job and my hobby, but I don't really have any projects I've shared
- On the weekends I like to read (check out my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52490059-miller-hall)) and take walks with my wife and my dog
- I'm originally from North Carolina, and I graduated from Clemson in 2016. I love all things Carolinas

## Work

- I have been an SDE at AWS in Arlington, Virginia since 2017
- I spent three years on a team focused on software quality during the region build process
- I now work on building edge solutions custom-built to customer needs
