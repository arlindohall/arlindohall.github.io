# Posts

This is a manually-updated list of posts I've written.
Some are marked as "Work in Progress" because I don't feel like they're ready to see the light of day/to be shared.
However, I'm trying to learn in public, and I think it's more important to share them than to have them in perfect shape.
Putting the "Work in Progress" message at the top is my way of forgiving myself for their imperfections until I'm more comfortable with the learn in public style of doing things.
