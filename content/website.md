# This Website

*(Work in Progress)*

I've been writing code for a job since 2017 (three years as I write this),
and I'm learning more every day. I've written a little bit of frontend code
at work, but the thing is that at work, I have lots of tooling that makes
it really easy and I haven't actaully learned buch about web fundamentals.

The reason I've built this website is to force myself to actually learn about
how frontend web technologies work, and as I learn more, hopefully this site
gets better as I do so.

In the meanwhile, this site is build as the following:

- I fetch all the content as markdown
- I use commonmark.js to render the markdown client-side

Some questions I thought of while I was making this website, and that you may
have for me are:

> Why did you use GitHub pages for your personal site?

Well, basically because it's really easy and basically free to set up a
website with GitHub pages. I don't want to invest much time or energy
into this when I'm not really committed to making something interesting
out of it. It's just a place to host stuff online.

> Why did you write your own client side code instead of just using Jekyll?

This is opposed to my answer to the last question, but I wanted a little
bit more control over the site and how it looked, and the ability to add
some dynamic functionality in the future if I decide to. Also, I didn't
want to learn a whole new tool (Jekyll themes) in order to be able to
have a website that was really customized.
