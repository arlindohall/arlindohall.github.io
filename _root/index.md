Miller Hall
===========

I am a software developer and tinkerer based in Herndon, Virginia.
Software is my job and my hobby, and my work and personal projects are listed below.
On the weekends I like to read (check out my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52490059-miller-hall)) and take walks with my wife and my dog.
I'm originally from North Carolina, and I graduated from Clemson in 2016.
I love all things Carolinas.

Work
----

-   I have been an SDE at AWS in Arlington, Virginia since 2017
-   I spent three years on a team focused on software quality during the region build process
-   I now work on building edge solutions custom-built to customer needs

Projects
--------

I've given up on most of these, as I prefer the peak of the dunning-kruger effect to the valleys.
