Posts
=====

This is a list of posts I've written.
I'm trying to learn in public, and I think it's more important to share the posts than to have them in perfect shape.

This whole site is built with pandoc and served with github pages because why do things the hard way when you do it quicker with free tools!

Post List
---------

- [Generating random data in `{fi,ba,z,}sh`](/posts/random-strings-in-bash.html)
- [Make your own website like this one](/posts/build-a-website-with-pandoc-and-pages.html)
